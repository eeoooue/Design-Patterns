# Strategy

Behavioural pattern which provides an explicit & modular approach to code reuse.

Strategy interfaces are created which outline some Strategy behaviour to be implemented by concrete strategy classes.

Classes that use the behaviour should have an instance of the concrete strategy they implement (example of composition).
