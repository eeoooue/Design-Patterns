# Abstract Factory

Creational pattern in which we use separate factory classes to create products, for which a common interface (across the different factories exists).

In the abstract factory pattern, we introduce specialised factories to create specific objects of an anticipated abstraction. 

This enables polymorphism and allows us to rotate between contexts at a high level of abstraction at runtime.

The Abstract Factory pattern consists of

- Some **AbstractProducts**
- An **AbstractFactory** 
- Some **ConcreteFactories**
- Some **ConcreteProducts**
