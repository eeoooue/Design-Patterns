# Iterator

Behavioural pattern which provides a consistent way to iterate over a collection of objects for which a common interface exists.

We might store instances of some family of objects in trees, hashtables, arrays, linked-lists etc. and might want a common way to traverse these collections.

To implement the Iterator pattern we should create a method in each collection class that returns an Iterator object for traversing the collection.
